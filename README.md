# Physics Explosions Spigot

## Video Demonstration: https://i.imgur.com/u9rKDdO.mp4

This adds some cool physics to exploded blocks
it works for both creeper and tnt explosions, and anything else that explodes
it works best on the sides of mountains, and overhangs, if you can find any.

**NOTES**:
  - This is NOT going to work well on a production server. It's a cool experiment that may/may not work, that's all.
  - I will accept literally any PR (probably) feel free to contribute
  - This is inspired by [Block Physics](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/block-physics.7862/), a plugin from 5 years ago, that has been abandoned.
  - The Block Physics plugin goes as far as importing an entire physics engine. This plugin just does a little vertical pathfinding, that is 'neatly' documented via comments (you're welcome).
